      <title>Pinus Sylvestris</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/07/</link>

      <guid>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/07/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinus sylvestris&lt;/em&gt; is a common pine species that is native to Eurasia. You may recognise their scaly pine cone (the female), but in fact all pine trees have male cones too – usually smaller and less conspicuous than their female counterparts. The male cones produce pollen, which is brought by wind to the female cone, where it fertilises the egg, forming a seed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All pines are Gymnosperms, which in its Greek origins means ‘naked seed’. Unlike the more common Angiosperms - flowering trees that produce seeds enclosed in an ovule (e.g. apples), Gymnosperms’ are exposed and form on the surface of the plant.

      <title>The Wonderful Physics of Snowflakes</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/06/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:02:52 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This story is about a substance that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any more contradictory: It is mundane in its omnipresence, while oozing with symbolism. It forms the basis of all life on this planet, while being capable of unleashing destructive forces of unrivalled power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of being formed from two of the three most common elements in the universe, pure, liquid water is an incredibly valuable good characterised by physical properties that are unusual to say the least. Water is a small molecule that occurs on earth in solid, liquid and gaseous form. This is remarkable, as most similarly small molecules would only occur in gaseous form under terrestrial conditions. Whether a substance occurs as solid, liquid or gas, is largely determined by temperature and pressure. If temperatures on Earth drop below 0°C the rules of the interplay between water molecules change substantially: Whereas water in liquid form is best described as a dancing frenzy of water molecules that only form connected groups for a short time, the dancing abates as water solidifies, and its molecules form tight formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we take a close look at a snowflake, we have to take note of a certain &lt;em&gt;sixness&lt;/em&gt; to it. Though, to say they were six-sided would do them a grave injustice, for they have many more sides than that! To capture this essence of &lt;em&gt;sixness&lt;/em&gt;, we use the term &lt;em&gt;symmetry&lt;/em&gt;. In the case of the six-fold rotational symmetry of the snowflake, this simply states that after turning the snowflake one sixth of a whole rotation, it appears indistinguishable from the original configuration. The symmetry of a snowflake is visible to the naked eye, yet it manifests the interplay of individual water molecules that each measure less than a fifth of a billionth of a meter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on pressure and temperature, water molecules can gather in a variety of formations giving rise to no less than fifteen different types of ice. However, most of these types of ice only form under special pressures and temperatures. Snow and virtually all other forms of ice on earth are formed by so-called &lt;em&gt;ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is characterised by hexagonal formations of water molecules that collectively give rise to a crystal lattice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to molecules of liquid water, where the angle between two hydrogen atoms is 105°, in ice, the water molecule becomes stretched to better accommodate the molecules in the crystal lattice, resulting in a slightly larger bonding angle of 109.5°. Therefore, water molecules in ice need more space than the same number of molecules in liquid water. This accounts for the peculiar expansion of water as it is cooled. This behaviour that is very uncommon in the molecular world, and it contributes to the fact that earth is such a hospitable planet for life. For, were it not for its lower density, ice would not float on water, bodies of water would freeze from bottom to top. However, ice does float and aquatic organisms can spend cold periods in liquid water.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What can a scary furry devil figure like the Krampus have to do with romanticism?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between the 16th and 19th centuries, Nikolo and Krampus appeared as an unequal couple at treating rites on the eve of the feast of Saint Nicholas on 6th December and while one brings gifts the other one threatens the children with chain, rod and butte. In Baroque period Saint Nicholas games in the vicinity of monasteries developed into sacred plays that were performed in courtyards and inns.They included catechetical scenes between good and evil, often angels and devils fought over the soul of a dying man.
From the 18th century on such games were forbidden by church and secular authorities.They were considered outdated and called &amp;ldquo;pagan and unworthy of a true Christian&amp;rdquo;. However, exactly this &amp;ldquo;pagan&amp;rdquo; nature was of particular interest for national Romantics a century later. They related the figures to germanic myths and wanted to find their ancient origins, overlooking the fact that the texts of the traditional St. Nicholas games, in which the devilish armies appear, had theological roots.

      <title>Do you remember that taste?</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/04/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas time! Your eyes are full with winking colourful lights, soft white snow covers the streets and your taste buds awaken when you think about that sweet, fragrant gingerbread you are used to having every year! But wait&amp;hellip; How can you remember it so well?
Scents and flavours are powerful time machines and can, more than images and sounds, throw us back to the past. Neuroscientists have always been fascinated by this phenomenon and tried to understand more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When biting into a gingerbread cookie, its smell travels to the so called &lt;em&gt;glomeruli&lt;/em&gt; in our nasal cavity and its sweet taste reaches thousands of taste buds on our tongue. Both these structures contain hundreds of thousands of tiny nerve endings that, once activated by scents and flavours, send messages straight up to the brain. These signals run much faster than your car! At a speed of about 50m/s (180km/h), they travel through two relay stations in the central nervous system, the &lt;em&gt;medulla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;thalamus&lt;/em&gt;, before reaching their final destination, the gustatory cortex! Here, millions of neurons are ready to receive and process the messages sent by the tongue and assign them an identity. This is when you realise that your cookie is sweet, not too gingery, and has a nice hint of cinnamon! Neuroscientists at the Columbia University, in New York, have now demonstrated that the perception of different tastes is mediated by different areas in the gustatory cortex. Using a technique called &lt;em&gt;optogenetics&lt;/em&gt;, they were able to artificially activate or shut down what they thought were the bitter and sweet areas in the gustatory cortex of laboratory mice. Then, they trained mice to lick from a water bottle while their cortex was artificially activated. Mice whose bitter area was activated when licking, progressively reduced their licking. On the other hand, mice whose sweet cortical area was activated during the task showed a marked increase of the licking behaviour [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this has got nothing to do with remembering the familiar and delicious taste of our grandmother&amp;rsquo;s gingerbread cookies, right? Correct! The message in the gustatory cortex keeps travelling though our nervous system, and reaches the so called limbic system. This is the most ancient part of our brain and contains areas that are strongly implicated in processing emotions and memories. In particular, the &lt;em&gt;hippocampus&lt;/em&gt; (from the Latin sea horse, for its shape) receives signals from the gustatory cortex and matches them to signals that have already travelled through our brain, and for which a memory has been established. This is how your brain safely keeps the secret of your grandma&amp;rsquo;s cookies. Be reassured, you will never forget it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The baker can deliver sweet foods to you in a thousand forms, for the bee works for him. (M. V. Martialis, XIV, 222)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would Christmas be like without cookies? The small portioned biscuits sweeten our everyday life, especially during the advent season. For some time now, eating them has not been about nutrition but about self-indulgence, which is regretted by some after the holidays. It was a very different story around 7000 years ago when people in Mesopotamia built the first agricultural settlements and in doing so, took the decisive step on the way to the world we live in today. The cultivation and processing of grain was one of the basic prerequisites for settlement, and it was hard-earned bread, literally, until the harvested grain could be used to make porridge, beer or bread for daily consumption. Our ancestors regularly suffered from malnutrition, and their skeletons show wear and tear from the monotonous grinding process of the grain to flour, one of the main ingredients for bakery.
Even from these very early civilizations, such as the Sumerians or Egyptians, recipes of pastries sweetened with spices, fruits and honey have survived over the ages. These treats were probably reserved only for members of the highest social classes. The Romans already knew the profession of the confectioner, the Pistor Dulcarius, who made honey bakery for feast tables of the rich and for offerings.
Ever since sweet cookies were introduced to more and more households during the 19th century, the number of recipes has greatly expanded. What is the &amp;ldquo;oldest cookie recipe&amp;rdquo; we know? A likely candidate is a recipe from Sumer from the 3rd dynasty of Ur (dating from around 4000 years before today) which can be derived from administrative texts found on cuneiform tablets (see graphic).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Earwormology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this time of the year, have you already had the song “Last Christmas” by 80’s band Wham! stuck in your head? Earworms - or Involuntary musical imagery (INMI) as science calls them - surely are familiar to everyone. In his book “Musicophilia”, Oliver Sacks refers to them as “brainworms” or “cognitively infectious musical agents” [1]. They constitute musical fragments 15-20 seconds in length corresponding to a theme of 3-4 bars that keep on circling round and round in one’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most studies have focused on what structures within music cause earworms and who is susceptible to them. The answer is almost everyone seems to be getting earworms [2]. Sometimes, earworms are induced by a memory. But they can occur spontaneously too. They are favoured if a song is simple and contains a lot of repeating elements or if the song itself is re-played again and again. Much of this seems like common sense, but a group of psychologists did a study with 3,000 participants to confirm this. They compared the structure of 200 songs that frequently cause INMI with songs that were never mentioned to induce earworms and concluded that earworms occur more frequently when a song is faster, has a generic (easy-to-remember) melody that also contains some unique, unexpected twist such as leaps or repetitions that sets it apart from the “average” song [3].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategies to combat earworms include consciously singing or listening to the song in full, trying to displace the earworm with another song, or trying to engage in some more demanding activity (e.g. reading) [4]. We haven’t found much sound, convincing scientific evidence that any of these actually work, however, feel free to try them at your own discretion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, little is known about the neuronal basis of earworms. The phenomenon is not studied a lot, probably because it’s is not really a disease, though it can be annoying. We found one experiment in the scientific literature that we thought we explain to you in a bit more detail [5]. It is trying to figure out where in the brain earworms are formed. The scientists asked several trained musicians to either (a) listen to music or (b) imagine music. They then identified the brain areas that are active in both listening to and imagining music. This is a first step. But is voluntarily imagining a piece of music really the same as having an earworm? And what about the regions that are only active in imagining music but not during listening to music? It is not possible to identify those with the current study design. Furthermore, what is the cellular basis for earworms? Which type of brain cells are involved? Where do the triggering signals come from, do they originate from within the brain? As always, attempting to answer one simple question (“Where in the brain do earworms reside?”), leads us down the rabbit hole, and reveals how little we understand about how music interacts with our brains.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Christmas Lecture As Wall Newspaper</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/01/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The weeks leading up to Christmas have always had a special appeal to many students of the natural sciences; mulled wine sold at every corner, an abundance of occasions to socialise, but also a distinct notion that science should not only be taught, but should be actively engaged with. This notion is conveyed by numerous exciting, entertaining, as well as educational Christmas lectures that leave a lasting impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Christmas lectures have a long tradition. Many of them are accessible to the public, and are highly popular due to their spectacular experimental demonstrations. Hence, many Christmas lectures, such as those by the London Royal Institution, have become institutions in their own right, attracting huge audiences that marvel at the many wonders presented by world-class scientists about their disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Christmas calendar was conceived with this tradition in mind. It represents our attempt at taking science out of the lab and into the pre-Christmas buzz, and to entertain and educate. In the course of the next twenty-four days, we will present a topic related to Christmas every day from a science perspective. However, today, to launch this project, the personal level and some hands-on science shall take centre stage. You are cordially invited to join us &lt;strong&gt;today from 4pm in our temporary office space at Gerbergasse 3 in Villach&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like watch a Christmas lecture online, we&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend those by the Royal Institution. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rigb.org/christmas-lectures&#34;&gt;Their website&lt;/a&gt; gives you access to many lectures from past years. If you speak German, you might also want to tune into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/207325456862661/?active_tab=about&#34;&gt;Christmas lecture by TU Graz phycisist Gernot Pottlacher&lt;/a&gt;, who will present a journey through the phase diagram. It will be streamed live under starting at 16:15 on 12.12.18.
