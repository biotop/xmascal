  <title>The Oldest Cookie Recipes - Biotop Christmas Calendar</title>
  
  <meta name="description" content="The baker can deliver sweet foods to you in a thousand forms, for the bee works for him. (M. V. Martialis, XIV, 222)

What would Christmas be these days without cookies? The small portioned biscuits sweeten our everyday life, especially during the advent season. For some time now eating them has not been about nutrition but about the small delight, which sometimes is regretted after the holidays. It was different about 7000 years ago when people in Mesopotamia built the first agricultural settlements and thus took the decisive step on the way to our world today. The cultivation and processing of grain was one of the basic prerequisites for settlement, and it was hard-earned bread, literally, until the harvested grain was used to produce porridge, beer or bread for daily consumption. Our ancestors suffered from malnutrition, from wear and tear from the monotonous grinding process of the grain to flour, one of the main ingredients for bakery.
Nevertheless, also in early civilizations, such as the Sumerians or Egyptians, we do find recipes of pastries sweetened with spices, fruits and honey, even if these were probably reserved for only a few of the highest class. The Romans already knew the profession of the confectioner, the Pistor Dulcarius, who made honey bakery for feast tables of the rich and for offerings.
Since sweet cookies were introduced to more and more households in the 19th century, a large number of recipes have been known, but what is actually the &ldquo;oldest cookie recipe&rdquo; we know? A worthy candidate is probably a recipe from Sumer from the 3rd dynasty of Ur (around 4000 before today) which can be derived from administrative texts on cuneiform tablets (see graphic).
