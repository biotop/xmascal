      <title>Gingerbreadhouses and Architecture</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, you read about the legendary gingerbread house in the fairytale Hansel and Gretel. But did you know that there is also a term called &amp;ldquo;Gingerbread architecture&amp;rdquo;? And no, unfortunately this doesn’t mean buildings actually made of gingerbread&amp;hellip; The definition of gingerbread house architecture originates from the building style of the late 19th century in Haiti.
The gingerbread movement began in 1881, with the construction of the Haitian National Palace. This building served as a model and set new standards of construction in the region. The majority of the gingerbread buildings in Haiti are located in Port-o-Prince and are planned by just three Haitian architects, who found inspiration during their studies in Paris. In 1895, Georges Baussan, Léon Mathon, and Joseph-Eugène Maximilien wanted to take advantage of the nascent architectural movement by adapting the contemporary style of French holiday homes to the tropical climate of Haiti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gingerbread houses are usually constructed out of wood, masonry, or stone and clay. Characteristics of this architectural style are vibrant patterns, flamboyant colors and richly ornamented balustrades. The houses were constructed with tall doors, high ceilings and large windows opening on vast galleries in order to take advantage of the prevailing winds. The gingerbread expression was adopted in the 1950s by American tourists, who compared the style to that of Victorian-era buildings in the US.
As the houses are expensive to maintain, today many of them fall into disrepair by natural aging, although they withstood the the 2010 earthquake better than modern concrete buildings. In 2010, the Gingerbread Houses of Haiti were included on the World Monuments Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to stroll around in a city that is actually made out of gingerbread you have to visit the Museum of Architecture in London. Every year a group of architects, designers and engineers create an entire gingerbread city, with “&amp;hellip;the aim [&amp;hellip;] to connect the public with architecture through an innovative display designed for the holiday season.” This year&amp;rsquo;s exhibition &amp;lsquo;Imagining the Future City&amp;rsquo; is on from the 8th of December 2018 to the 6th of January 2019, if you happen to be in the vicinity. Enjoy without tasting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gingerbread House</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/13/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Especially around Christmas time we encounter a special form of pastry - the gingerbread house. It is common in many cultures. But what kind of ideas are behind a sweet edible house and how far can they be traced back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much to our archaeologists&amp;rsquo; delight, we have found model houses from the material remains of different cultures. They help us to piece together a better picture of the architecture of that time, since the remains of settlements from different periods that can be examined during excavations provide only small insights. Built of wood and clay, only the floor areas of most houses are preserved and the clay models of houses allow us to get a better idea of architectural styles. Model houses from Pharaonic Egypt (about 3900 years ago), Bronze Age Greece (about 3700 years ago) or Iron Age Central Europe (about 2600 years ago) have been found. But even if their shape is reminiscent of gingerbread houses, these clay models naturally have nothing to do with today&amp;rsquo;s Christmas tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also finds of honey biscuits in the form of plants, animals and people that were used as sacrificial cakes and grave goods in ancient Egypt. This use continues through antiquity and according to legend &amp;ldquo;Psyche&amp;rdquo; even managed to bribe &amp;ldquo;Kerberos&amp;rdquo; with honey cake when entering and leaving the underworld. The German name &amp;ldquo;Lebkuchen&amp;rdquo; might be derived from the Latin name &amp;ldquo;libum&amp;rdquo; for the sacrificial breads, which were offered in sacrificial rituals to the Roman house gods at the Lararium. The exotic spices that were necessary for the production of ginger bread became increasingly available in Central Europe during the time of the crusades and so the pastry experienced a new high point of popularity. Gingerbread was very much in demand as a long-lasting &amp;ldquo;power food&amp;rdquo; for on the road and also popular as festive pastries. Due to the laborious procurement of the ingredients, however, it was considered a luxury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us closer to the origin of the gingerbread house, because in times of famine (as in Europe at the beginning of the 14th century) the idea of the land of milk and honey, the land of abundance, developed. Pieter Bruegel the Elder referred to it in two works, &amp;ldquo;Flemish Proverbs&amp;rdquo; (1559) and &amp;ldquo;The Land of Cockaigne&amp;rdquo; (1567). In the first one, one of the proverbs depicted in a scene of 80, refers to the saying: &amp;ldquo;There the roof is covered with flat cakes (there is abundance)&amp;rdquo;. The idea that a &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;little house was made of bread [&amp;hellip;] and covered with cake&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; found expression in fairy tales and stories and was written down by the Brothers Grimm in their Children&amp;rsquo;s and Household Tales as the story of Hansel and Gretel in 1812. The main focus here is the poverty in the parental home and the decision to abandon the children. In contrast, the lavish gingerbread house of the anthropophagous witch serves as a symbol of abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great popularity of the fairy tale led to the spread of gingerbread houses in many German-speaking, Eastern European, Scandinavian and English-speaking countries, even though the historical background of the ideas is usually no longer appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an archaeologist &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://biotop.co/en/person/martin-fera/&#34;&gt;Martin Fera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has researched pharaonic graves in Sudan, bronze age saltmines in Hallstatt or viking burials in Norway. Currently, his research is focused on using data from landscape scans to better understand early iron age cultures in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shine A Light</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/12/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2018 17:02:52 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the northern hemisphere, daylight dwindles as we approach Christmas - or winter solstice to be more precise. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that we&amp;rsquo;ve developed the custom of putting up nice incandescent decorations to combat the darkness: city centres bathed in Christmas lights, houses adorned with - or at times disfigured by - glowing Christmas decorations; candles lit on the Christmas tree or advent wreath. There&amp;rsquo;s really no shortage of occasions to ponder the magnificence, the warmth, or indeed the physics of light!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, today, we shall take a rather unusual perspective. Rather than looking into what makes a burning candle glow, or investigating how we can make a wire light up by sending electrons through it, we are turning to a more unusual, but nonetheless fascinating curiosity - the phenomenon of molecules that emit light without the involvement of heat, more accurately referred to as luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All molecules are made of atoms, which, in turn, are composed of protons and neutrons that form a nucleus, and electrons that surround it. When atoms form molecules, electrons are shared between the nuclei of different atoms, thereby satisfying the thirst for electrons of each nucleus. In very simple terms, that&amp;rsquo;s what chemical bonds are all about. These shared electrons are negatively charged and attracted by the positively charged nuclei. However, it depends on the nature of the chemical elements that make up the molecule how strong this attraction is. Depending on how strongly electrons are attracted, they can be said to have a different energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the 20th century marked a turning point in the physics of very small things - and by extension molecules. The work of the pioneers of quantum mechanics has led us to realise that energy comes in very small, clearly defined packages rather than in a continuum. The energy of electrons in a molecule is no exception: Electrons in a chemical bond sit at a very clearly defined energy level, called the ground-state, and it is only the lowest of many possible ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By shining a light of a particular colour - or, put more precisely, of a defined wavelength - onto a molecule, we can provide the electrons in the chemical bond of this molecule with just the right amount of energy to lift them to the next level. Once there, they&amp;rsquo;ll generally stay up there for a short time, before they fall back to their ground state. Energy can&amp;rsquo;t be lost, though, it can only be converted. So, what happens with the energy that we put into the molecule by shining a light at it? Some of it makes molecules jiggle a lot and is ultimately converted into heat, while some of it may be in turn released in the form of light, but with less energy - or in other words a more reddish colour than the light we originally used to &amp;ldquo;excite&amp;rdquo; the molecule. This is one form of luminescence in a nutshell. It is the reason why your G&amp;amp;T glows in a pale blue when you&amp;rsquo;re in a club, which has UV lights on, it is the reason why glow-in-the-dark paint works and it is but a small taste of the many wonders that await in the world of glowing matter&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Travelling Salesman Problem or How to optimise your Christmas shopping trip</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/11/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The travelling salesman problem is about finding the shortest route between a number of places, visiting each place only once before returning to the starting position. In the attached video, we show the result of a simple algorithm that uses one of many available optimisation approaches to find the shortest route between the central points of all countries. The shortest route can mean shortest by distance or travelling time, or the most cost-effective (or any other measurable quantity or combinations thereof that should be minimised). For a small number of places one wants to visit, it is still relatively easy to calculate all possible round-trips and rank them to find the shortest/best one. However, with a growing number of “cities” on the itinerary, the problem gets very hard to solve indeed. For example given 10 places to visit, there are already a staggering 10! = 3,628,800 number of possible routes. Trying to solve these kind of problems exactly for a large number of position would take much too long even with good computers. Therefore, approximations to solving the travelling salesman problem have been worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding good approaches to address this problem are important in many areas: logistics - the efficient and timely delivery of goods -  is an obvious one. When drilling holes in circuit boards, which requires the drilling of many, many thousands of holes, having an efficient ways of doing so can save a company time and money. On a more personal level, you can also use solutions to the travelling salesman problem to optimise your Christmas shopping route. The “Christkind” must have a particularly neat solution at hand, given that it manages to visit every single household in Austria in just a single night.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Natural History of Reindeer</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/10/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rudolf, Dasher, Comet, Dancer, Cupid, Prancer, Donner, Blitzen and Vixen. They are the deer that help Santa carry his carriage full of presents on Christmas Eve. Specifically, they are reindeer (their scientific name is Rangifer tarandus), one of the forty or so species of deer that exist in the world and the only one that can be found living in the Arctic. But the fact that they are native close to his home is not the only reason that Santa might have chosen them as his companions. They also love travelling, some of them covering distances of up to 5000 km in a year, making their migration the farthest one of any terrestrial mammal.
Reindeer are also very well equipped to cope with the cold. From the soles of their hooves to the tips of their noses, they are all covered in hair, which is so good at insulating their body heat that they can lie down on the snow without melting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their noses are also very special—not only because of Rudolf’s red one. They have very intricate nostrils with an increased internal surface area to warm up the incoming cold air. Their nostril&amp;rsquo;s insides are also covered with thin hairs where water in the air can condense and then be sniffed in into the throat. Of course, being so good at maintaining their body temperature, they can also afford getting much of their water from eating snow.
All species of deer belong to the &lt;em&gt;Artiodactyla&lt;/em&gt; order of mammals which includes all hoofed animals whose weight is supported by two toes, for example pigs, cattle, goats and sheep, as well as giraffes and hippos. The first deer might have appeared over 20 million years ago, the oldest known reindeer fossil has been dated to 400,000 years ago - the time that the last Ice Age started. So reindeer have been around for a long time and Santa has certainly not been the only one to use them for transportation. Archaeological evidence indicates that Siberian tribes were riding reindeer 2,000 years ago and many tribes today still ride them or use them to pull their sledges.

      <title>Christmas 1000 Years ago</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was Christmas celebrated 1000 years ago?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas as a celebration of the birth of Jesus is one of the most important holidays of Christian communities. While it was already celebrated in Rome in the 4th century A.D., in the early Middle Ages it took a step back in favor of the celebration of the Epiphany of the Lord. With the coronation of Charlemagne as emperor at Christmas 800, it regained popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what was the situation like in Carinthia 1000 years ago? What were the secular and ecclesiastical conditions like and what do we know about the language in which any Christian liturgy took place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the ninth century a village named Uillac, located at a bridge over the Drau river, was known in the March of Carantania. It belonged to the bishopric of Bamberg since 1007 and formed a part of the East Franconian Empire within the whole Duchy of Carinthia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The Christian faith was spread among the Carantan Slavs by Abraham of Freising (940-&lt;sup&gt;993&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; AD), among others. Between 972 and 1039, in the course of the missionary work, the Freising monuments, religious texts in the Karantane/slovenian language, were created. The monasteries of St. Georgen (shortly after 1000) and Ossiach (1028) were built during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image 3:&lt;/strong&gt; As far as we know Christmas was also celebrated 1000 years ago. But until the 16th century gifts were rather offered on the day of St. Nicholas of Myra. Christmas trees (from the 16th century), Advent wreaths (from 1839) and Advent calendars (from about 1851) are later additions.&lt;/p&gt;

So does this mean that people planned to divorce a lot around Christmas? Or did the relaxed atmosphere around Christmas with the whole family coming together in a crowded house full of alcoholic beverages somehow lead to a lot of divorces? Or is Christmas actually a holiday of divorce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking only at these data might lead you to wrong conclusions about causal relationships between highly correlated data series such as the ones above. Correlation (e.g., two events occurring together), however, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation&#34;&gt;does not imply causation&lt;/a&gt;. (i.e., one is the cause of the other).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some such cum hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for “with this, therefore because of this”) fallacies can quite easily be excluded using common sense (Christmas was clearly not established to celebrate divorces) but others are a lot trickier (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wilson-nesbitt.com/news-updates/Divorce/7282/Why-do-divorce-rates-double-over-Christmas, for example, indeed argues that the atmosphere at Christmas leads to unusually high numbers of divorces&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;). Additional experimentation and data can help to exclude some possible causal relationships or add additional evidence supporting others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other examples of so-called “spurious correlations” (i.e., correlated events without a direct causal relationship) are presented on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations&#34;&gt;this recommended website&lt;/a&gt;. There, it is for example uncovered that the consumption of margarine is correlated with the divorce rate in the US federal state of Maine. But it might be rather easy to see that there is no real causal relationship between these two events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A more serious discussion of the often-made mistake to conclude a causative relationship from highly correlated data can be found in this recommended video from Khan academy. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/scatterplots-a1/creating-interpreting-scatterplots/v/correlation-and-causality&#34;&gt;Here, it is discussed whether eating breakfast could be a possible solution to teen obesity?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you might want to be extra careful to not mix up correlation and causation, which are indeed two very different things. Confusing them leads to a lot of false claims that are seemingly supported by real data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing, however, is for sure: Christmas is also (highly correlates with) Egg Nog season. You might want to do some experimentation yourselves to work out whether there is a causal relationship between the two ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pinus Sylvestris</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/07/</link>

      <guid>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/07/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinus sylvestris&lt;/em&gt; is a common pine species that is native to Eurasia. You may recognise their scaly pine cone (the female), but in fact all pine trees have male cones too – usually smaller and less conspicuous than their female counterparts. The male cones produce pollen, which is brought by wind to the female cone, where it fertilises the egg, forming a seed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All pines are Gymnosperms, which in its Greek origins means ‘naked seed’. Unlike the more common Angiosperms - flowering trees that produce seeds enclosed in an ovule (e.g. apples), Gymnosperms’ are exposed and form on the surface of the plant.

      <title>The Wonderful Physics of Snowflakes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This story is about a substance that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any more contradictory: It is mundane in its omnipresence, while oozing with symbolism. It forms the basis of all life on this planet, while being capable of unleashing destructive forces of unrivalled power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of being formed from two of the three most common elements in the universe, pure, liquid water is an incredibly valuable good characterised by physical properties that are unusual to say the least. Water is a small molecule that occurs on earth in solid, liquid and gaseous form. This is remarkable, as most similarly small molecules would only occur in gaseous form under terrestrial conditions. Whether a substance occurs as solid, liquid or gas, is largely determined by temperature and pressure. If temperatures on Earth drop below 0°C the rules of the interplay between water molecules change substantially: Whereas water in liquid form is best described as a dancing frenzy of water molecules that only form connected groups for a short time, the dancing abates as water solidifies, and its molecules form tight formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we take a close look at a snowflake, we have to take note of a certain &lt;em&gt;sixness&lt;/em&gt; to it. Though, to say they were six-sided would do them a grave injustice, for they have many more sides than that! To capture this essence of &lt;em&gt;sixness&lt;/em&gt;, we use the term &lt;em&gt;symmetry&lt;/em&gt;. In the case of the six-fold rotational symmetry of the snowflake, this simply states that after turning the snowflake one sixth of a whole rotation, it appears indistinguishable from the original configuration. The symmetry of a snowflake is visible to the naked eye, yet it manifests the interplay of individual water molecules that each measure less than a fifth of a billionth of a meter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on pressure and temperature, water molecules can gather in a variety of formations giving rise to no less than fifteen different types of ice. However, most of these types of ice only form under special pressures and temperatures. Snow and virtually all other forms of ice on earth are formed by so-called &lt;em&gt;ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is characterised by hexagonal formations of water molecules that collectively give rise to a crystal lattice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to molecules of liquid water, where the angle between two hydrogen atoms is 105°, in ice, the water molecule becomes stretched to better accommodate the molecules in the crystal lattice, resulting in a slightly larger bonding angle of 109.5°. Therefore, water molecules in ice need more space than the same number of molecules in liquid water. This accounts for the peculiar expansion of water as it is cooled. This behaviour that is very uncommon in the molecular world, and it contributes to the fact that earth is such a hospitable planet for life. For, were it not for its lower density, ice would not float on water, bodies of water would freeze from bottom to top. However, ice does float and aquatic organisms can spend cold periods in liquid water.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What can a scary furry devil figure like the Krampus have to do with romanticism?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime between the 16th and 19th century, &amp;ldquo;Nikolo&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Krampus&amp;rdquo; appeared as an unequal couple at treating rites on the eve of the feast of Saint Nicholas on 6th December. While one brings gifts the other one threatens the children with chain, rod and butte. In the Baroque period, Saint Nicholas games in the vicinity of monasteries developed into sacred plays that were performed in courtyards and inns. They included catechetical scenes between good and evil, often angels and devils fought over the soul of a dying man.
From the 18th century onwards, such games were forbidden by both the church and secular authorities.They were considered outdated and called &amp;ldquo;pagan and unworthy of a true Christian&amp;rdquo;. However, exactly this &amp;ldquo;pagan&amp;rdquo; nature was of particular interest for romanticists a century later. They related the figures to germanic myths and wanted to find their ancient origins, overlooking the fact that the texts of the traditional St. Nicholas games, in which the devilish armies appear, had theological roots.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do you remember that taste?</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/04/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2018 17:02:52 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas time! Your eyes are full with winking colourful lights, soft white snow covers the streets and your taste buds awaken when you think about that sweet, fragrant gingerbread you are used to having every year! But wait&amp;hellip; How can you remember it so well?
Scents and flavours are powerful time machines and can, more than images and sounds, throw us back to the past. Neuroscientists have always been fascinated by this phenomenon and tried to understand more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When biting into a gingerbread cookie, its smell travels to the so called &lt;em&gt;glomeruli&lt;/em&gt; in our nasal cavity and its sweet taste reaches thousands of taste buds on our tongue. Both these structures contain hundreds of thousands of tiny nerve endings that, once activated by scents and flavours, send messages straight up to the brain. These signals run much faster than your car! At a speed of about 50m/s (180km/h), they travel through two relay stations in the central nervous system, the &lt;em&gt;medulla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;thalamus&lt;/em&gt;, before reaching their final destination, the gustatory cortex. Here, millions of neurons are ready to receive and process the messages sent by the tongue and assign them an identity. This is when you realise that your cookie is sweet, not too gingery, and has a nice hint of cinnamon! Neuroscientists at the Columbia University in New York, have now demonstrated that the perception of different tastes is mediated by different areas in the gustatory cortex. Using a technique called &lt;em&gt;optogenetics&lt;/em&gt;, they were able to artificially activate or shut down what they thought were the bitter and sweet areas in the gustatory cortex of laboratory mice. Then, they trained mice to lick from a water bottle while their cortex was artificially activated. Mice whose bitter area was activated when licking progressively reduced their licking. On the other hand, mice whose sweet cortical area was activated during the task showed a marked increase of the licking behaviour [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this has got nothing to do with remembering the familiar and delicious taste of our grandmother&amp;rsquo;s gingerbread cookies, right? Correct! The message in the gustatory cortex keeps travelling though our nervous system, and reaches the so called limbic system. This is the most ancient part of our brain and contains areas that are strongly implicated in processing emotions and memories. In particular, the &lt;em&gt;hippocampus&lt;/em&gt; (from the Latin sea horse, for its shape) receives signals from the gustatory cortex and matches them to signals that have already travelled through our brain, and for which a memory has been established. This is how your brain safely keeps the secret of your grandma&amp;rsquo;s cookies. Be reassured, you will never forget it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Oldest Cookie Recipe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The baker can deliver sweet foods to you in a thousand forms, for the bee works for him. (M. V. Martialis, XIV, 222)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would Christmas be like without cookies? The small portioned biscuits sweeten our everyday life, especially during the advent season. For some time now, eating them has not been about nutrition but about self-indulgence, which is regretted by some after the holidays. It was a very different story around 7000 years ago when people in Mesopotamia built the first agricultural settlements and in doing so, took the decisive step on the way to the world we live in today. The cultivation and processing of grain was one of the basic prerequisites for settlement, and it was hard-earned bread, literally, until the harvested grain could be used to make porridge, beer or bread for daily consumption. Our ancestors regularly suffered from malnutrition, and their skeletons show wear and tear from the monotonous grinding process of the grain to flour, one of the main ingredients for bakery.
Even from these very early civilizations, such as the Sumerians or Egyptians, recipes of pastries sweetened with spices, fruits and honey have survived over the ages. These treats were probably reserved only for members of the highest social classes. The Romans already knew the profession of the confectioner, the Pistor Dulcarius, who made honey bakery for feast tables of the rich and for offerings.
Ever since sweet cookies were introduced to more and more households during the 19th century, the number of recipes has greatly expanded. What is the &amp;ldquo;oldest cookie recipe&amp;rdquo; we know? A likely candidate is a recipe from Sumer from the 3rd dynasty of Ur (dating from around 4000 years before today) which can be derived from administrative texts found on cuneiform tablets (see graphic).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Earwormology</title>
      <link>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/02/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 17:02:52 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://biotop.co/xmascal/days/02/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this time of the year, have you already had the song “Last Christmas” by 80’s band Wham! stuck in your head? Earworms - or Involuntary musical imagery (INMI) as science calls them - surely are familiar to everyone. In his book “Musicophilia”, Oliver Sacks refers to them as “brainworms” or “cognitively infectious musical agents” [1]. They constitute musical fragments 15-20 seconds in length corresponding to a theme of 3-4 bars that keep on circling round and round in one’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most studies have focused on what structures within music cause earworms and who is susceptible to them. The answer is almost everyone seems to be getting earworms [2]. Sometimes, earworms are induced by a memory. But they can occur spontaneously too. They are favoured if a song is simple and contains a lot of repeating elements or if the song itself is re-played again and again. Much of this seems like common sense, but a group of psychologists did a study with 3,000 participants to confirm this. They compared the structure of 200 songs that frequently cause INMI with songs that were never mentioned to induce earworms and concluded that earworms occur more frequently when a song is faster, has a generic (easy-to-remember) melody that also contains some unique, unexpected twist such as leaps or repetitions that sets it apart from the “average” song [3].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategies to combat earworms include consciously singing or listening to the song in full, trying to displace the earworm with another song, or trying to engage in some more demanding activity (e.g. reading) [4]. We haven’t found much sound, convincing scientific evidence that any of these actually work, however, feel free to try them at your own discretion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, little is known about the neuronal basis of earworms. The phenomenon is not studied a lot, probably because it’s is not really a disease, though it can be annoying. We found one experiment in the scientific literature that we thought we explain to you in a bit more detail [5]. It is trying to figure out where in the brain earworms are formed. The scientists asked several trained musicians to either (a) listen to music or (b) imagine music. They then identified the brain areas that are active in both listening to and imagining music. This is a first step. But is voluntarily imagining a piece of music really the same as having an earworm? And what about the regions that are only active in imagining music but not during listening to music? It is not possible to identify those with the current study design. Furthermore, what is the cellular basis for earworms? Which type of brain cells are involved? Where do the triggering signals come from, do they originate from within the brain? As always, attempting to answer one simple question (“Where in the brain do earworms reside?”), leads us down the rabbit hole, and reveals how little we understand about how music interacts with our brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weeks leading up to Christmas have always had a special appeal to many students of the natural sciences; mulled wine sold at every corner, an abundance of occasions to socialise, but also a distinct notion that science should not only be taught, but should be actively engaged with. This notion is conveyed by numerous exciting, entertaining, as well as educational Christmas lectures that leave a lasting impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Christmas lectures have a long tradition. Many of them are accessible to the public, and are highly popular due to their spectacular experimental demonstrations. Hence, many Christmas lectures, such as those by the London Royal Institution, have become institutions in their own right, attracting huge audiences that marvel at the many wonders presented by world-class scientists about their disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Christmas calendar was conceived with this tradition in mind. It represents our attempt at taking science out of the lab and into the pre-Christmas buzz, and to entertain and educate. In the course of the next twenty-four days, we will present a topic related to Christmas every day from a science perspective. However, today, to launch this project, the personal level and some hands-on science shall take centre stage. You are cordially invited to join us &lt;strong&gt;today from 4pm in our temporary office space at Gerbergasse 3 in Villach&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like watch a Christmas lecture online, we&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend those by the Royal Institution. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rigb.org/christmas-lectures&#34;&gt;Their website&lt;/a&gt; gives you access to many lectures from past years. If you speak German, you might also want to tune into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/207325456862661/?active_tab=about&#34;&gt;Christmas lecture by TU Graz phycisist Gernot Pottlacher&lt;/a&gt;, who will present a journey through the phase diagram. It will be streamed live under starting at 16:15 on 12.12.18.
