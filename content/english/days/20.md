2018 has been an exciting and eventful year for Biotop. To celebrate this occasion and to provide a sneek peek into 2019, **we'd like to cordially invite you to visit us in our temporary office at Gerbergasse 3 in Villach**.

Starting at 6 pm, you can expect a program composed of a little look back at Biotop in 2018, and science slams by a neuroscientist, a molecular biologist, a fluid dynamics engineer and an archaeologist, who are coming to Villach especially for this occasion. Food and drinks will be provided!
