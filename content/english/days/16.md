Origami is an awesome artform! In transforming flat paper into intricate three dimensional shapes, it marries craftwmanship with a beautiful sort of mathematical ingenuity.

It is the perfect metaphor to express what we try to achieve with Biotop: ideas, rigor and accessible materials that are transformed into things of beauty as well as practical use.
