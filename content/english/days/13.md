Especially around Christmas time we encounter a special form of pastry in many cultures - the gingerbread house. But what kind of ideas are behind a sweet edible house and how far can they be traced back?

Much to our archaeologists' delight, we know model houses from the material remains of different cultures. They help us to get a better picture of the architecture of that time, since the remains of settlements from different periods that can be examined during excavations provide only small insights. Built of wood and clay, only the floor areas of the houses are preserved and the clay models of houses allow us to get a better idea of the rising areas. They display houses from Pharaonic Egypt (about 3900 years ago), Bronze Age Greece (about 3700 years ago) or were even used as urns in Iron Age Central Europe (about 2600 years ago).

But even if the shape is reminiscent of gingerbread houses, these clay models naturally have nothing to do with today's Christmas houses. There are finds of honey biscuits in the form of plants, animals and people in ancient Egypt as sacrificial cakes and grave goods. This use continues through antiquity and according to legend Psyche even managed to bribe Kerberos with honey cake when entering and leaving the underworld. From the Latin name "libum" for the sacrificial breads, which were offered in sacrificial rituals to the Roman house gods at the Lararium, also the German name Lebkuchen might be derived. The exotic spices that were necessary for the production arrived increasingly with the crusades to Central Europe and so the pastry experienced a new high point. Gingerbread was very much in demand as a long-lasting "power food" for on the road and as festive pastries, but due to the laborious procurement of the ingredients it was considered an exclusive pastry.

This brings us closer to the gingerbread house, because in times of famine, as in Europe at the beginning of the 14th century, the idea of the land of milk and honey, the land of abundance, developed. Pieter Bruegel the Elder referred to it in two works, in his "Flemish Proverbs" (1559) and in the picture "The Land of Cockaigne" (1567). In the first one, a scene (from over 80 others) refers to the proverb: "There the roof is covered with flat cakes (there is abundance)". The idea that a "...little house was made of bread [...] and covered with cake..." found expression in fairy tales and stories and was written down by the Brothers Grimm in their Children's and Household Tales as the tale of Hansel and Gretel in 1812. The main focus here is the poverty in the parental home and the decision to abandon the children and the gingerbread house of the anthropophagous witch serves as a symbol of abundance as a counterpole.

The great popularity of the fairy tale led to the spread of gingerbread houses in many German-speaking, Eastern European, Scandinavian and English-speaking countries, even though the historical background of the ideas is usually no longer present.
