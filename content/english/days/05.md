Between the 16th and 19th centuries, Nikolo and Krampus appeared as an unequal couple at treating rites on the eve of the feast of Saint Nicholas on 6th December and while one brings gifts the other one threatens the children with chain, rod and butte. In Baroque period Saint Nicholas games in the vicinity of monasteries developed into sacred plays that were performed in courtyards and inns.They included catechetical scenes between good and evil, often angels and devils fought over the soul of a dying man.
From the 18th century on such games were forbidden by church and secular authorities.They were considered outdated and called "pagan and unworthy of a true Christian". However, exactly this "pagan" nature was of particular interest for national Romantics a century later. They related the figures to germanic myths and wanted to find their ancient origins, overlooking the fact that the texts of the traditional St. Nicholas games, in which the devilish armies appear, had theological roots.
